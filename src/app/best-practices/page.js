            <h1>Best Practices</h1>
            <p>Over the years, we have acquired good habits of caring the proper way after our Elf cats, so here are the best practices from real-life experience.</p>
            <p>
                Currently, we have several adorable kittens looking for their forever homes. Each kitten is raised with love and care, and comes with a health guarantee. Here are some of our available kittens:
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Age of leaving</strong>
                    Our kittens leave us only after their vaccination course, being microchipped, and neutered (where appropriate).</li>
                <li><strong>Food</strong>
                    We stick to a strict diet for hairless cats, therefore all of our cats are on Royal Canin Sphynx.
                We usually recommend that new owners stick to the same diet, however it is up to the new owner to have their preference. If you are unsure what to feed your cat with and how much to budget for it, use our calculator to decide the best suitable option for you!</li>
